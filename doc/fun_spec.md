# Function Design
## Background
Starting 2012, jurisdictions across the country including King County have begun publishing health inspection scores using a standardized scoring system called LIVES. This open data allowed restaurant consumers to make informed decisions based on where they want to eat and motivated a lot of restaurant establishments to improve their inspection score in the hopes of attracting a bigger customer base.With this data and data from the Census Bureau's American Community survey weâ€™d like to:* Analyze trends.* View region specific information.* Build an interactive map to view correlation between demographic information and restaurant inspection scores.

## Use Cases
One example use case is to visually see if food inspection ratings are correlated with various demographic information in the city. This is a visual tool analogous to a [study][4] conducted in Ethiopia. The study found an association between food handling practices and various demographic markers such as income or marital status. Related demographic information is tracked by the US Census Bureau.
